# Silent Promise Rejection in Node.js Server
This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers where asynchronous operations might fail silently due to improper error handling.  The server uses `http.createServer` to handle requests. It simulates a situation where an asynchronous operation (e.g., database query, network request) can fail, returning null in the `fetchData` function.  Without proper error handling, this will cause the server to fail gracefully, without providing useful information for debugging.
